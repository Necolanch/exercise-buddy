# Exercise Buddy
### Nicholas Cruz

Exercise Buddy is a full stack web application built in React and Node.js/Express with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In this repository, you will find all of the files that have created the application. The folder titled "api" contains all of the files related to the server and the folder titled "exercise-buddy" contains all of the files related to the frontend. Render is the cloud host for deploying the application live on the internet and Planetscale is the cloud database so monitoring the logs on those platforms is good to track any issues. Please contact me using my email for any questions, necolanch@gmail.com.

### Maintenance
The main thing that has not been developed due to time constraints is the functionality of changing username and password of an account. On the Settings page, there are links with text that say that but they do not do anything yet.

From my view, the only other maintenance that could be done is styling of the filter section on the Search and Edit Plan pages. The API that is used to retrieve data about the exercises is the [https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises](Exercises API).
