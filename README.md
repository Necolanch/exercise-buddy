# Exercise Buddy
### Nicholas Cruz

Exercise Buddy is a full stack web application built in React and Node.js/Express with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In this repository, you will find all of the files that have created the application. The folder titled "api" contains all of the files related to the server and the folder titled "exercise-buddy" contains all of the files related to the frontend. Initially, it does not seem to require much maintenance other than keeping an eye on the logs of the Render and Planetscale platforms. Render is the cloud host for deploying the application live on the internet and Planetscale is the cloud database. Please contact me using my email for any questions, necolanch@gmail.com.
