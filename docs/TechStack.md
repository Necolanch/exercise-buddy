# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work? 

## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

I will use Figma for this. In Project and Portfolio 2, I made a UI kit and will probably refer to that one. This will allow to me to keep track of design choices for the front end.


## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

I intend to use React. This will provide value by showing I am proficient in using one of the most well-known front end frameworks.


## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

I will use a database but would like to use a state management library, Redux in particular, to get familiar with it. Using it would add a skill to my arsenal I can express when applying for jobs. We only talked about its usage in the class where we got introduced to React but did not use it.


## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose?

I will use Node because it is what I have used. The only other one I know of is Yarn and do not think it wise to deal with issues in that regard since it would be brand new to me.


## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

I will be using Express. I will use MVC architecture by creating folders for my controllers, routes, models, migrations, and seeders.
These things could be done with the Flask framework in Python. However, there are some key concepts I am unsure of how to do in Python yet but when we were introduced to it, the Python/Flask combo seemed very similar to NodeJS/Express.


## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

I am familiar with those three things and think Sequelize is great for working with relational databases. It is valuable to a project because it allows you to work with your database in your coding environment without constantly switching to something like MySQL Workbench to manage relationships. I want to get on the same level of familiarity with Sequelize/SQL as I am
with Mongoose/NoSQL.
