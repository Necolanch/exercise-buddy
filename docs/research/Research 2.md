## Google Analytics
Brief overview of research

* There is built-in automation. Analytics can analyze data and predict future actions people may take. These suggested predicitions can lead to retaining users.
* You can see reports of engagement such as what pages/screens are most used and details of user actions.
* Integrate other Google products such as Google Ads for increased return on investment by saving time and money.

## A/B Testing
Brief overview of research. 

* A/B Testing is when you have two versions of a product to measure/test against some preconceived notion of success. The version that brings the most of that success is what ends up as the final product.
* Certain elements are usually test such as headlines, forms, and amount of text on pages.
* Always test both versions at the same time, determine a correct amount of time to test, and keep tests consistent.

## Use Cases
Brief overview of research.

* It is user-oriented. We specify what actions are done by the user and what they see in a system.
* There are use cases that are most likely to happen when everything goes well and a user performs expected actions. There are edge cases which are not typical actions performed.
* If there are multiple roles for users, generalize use cases that are the same or similar across them. Write specific ones for unique cases.
