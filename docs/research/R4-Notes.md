This document contains general notes related to Design Theory

## Dialog Designs
Brief overview of research. 

* Dialog boxes should be used sparingly as they are disruptive.
* Alternative to dialog boxes are expansion of the current view.
* Dialogs should not include multiple steps. If that is the case, they warrant their own page(s).

## Confirmshaming
Brief overview of research. 

* This is a tactic to try to get people to sign up for marketing communications by having to click a button that blatantly states they are not interested in the product.
* With the wrong message, this can display offensive behavior and so many companies are not looking at it that way.
* Doing this can lead to a genuine loss of interest from consumers.

## Design Process
Brief overview of research. 

* Make the first ideas easy to understand with low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes. The core product features and use cases should be tangible.
* Create ideas for futher product features and low-fidelity visualized use cases.
* Create detailed/high-fidelity visualization of features and use cases.

**Note:**  
Resource 3 allowed me to see that once the basic use of the app is complete, the more advanced uses can come along.
