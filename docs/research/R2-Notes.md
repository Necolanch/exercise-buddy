## Topic

This document contains general notes related to Structure

## Wireframe benefits
Brief overview of research. 

* It is a simple process that lays out the architecture of the product, similar to a blueprint. It explores user experience and how the displayed content should be handled.
* The process allows the development and design teams to get on the same page early on.
* Delivery time of the product is faster because it reduces the risk of having to make time-consuming graphical changes, or even code changes later in the process.

## Wireframe DONT'S
Brief overview of research. 

* Do not go into too much detail. Start with the basics of what pieces on what pages perform what action.
* Do not emphasize color and design. Working with black and white imagery helps to focus on the process which is to finalize the layout of content.
* Do not wireframe every single page. Doing so can become overwhelming, add unnecessary work to a project timeline and even cause confusion.

## Logistics
Brief overview of research. 

* Understand what you are building and what problem(s) it will solve. Research competition to make sure you are not creating a duplicate.
* Target market. Research who is using your competitor's products and what group(s) do the majority of them fit into.
* Define how you want the app to be used. Eliminate as much possibility for misconduct to be done by users with malicious intentions.
