## Breaking Down Designs
Brief overview of research. 

* Atomic Design is the idea there are different levels of a design that gradually build up into the full user interface, similar to the human body.
* The smallest level is an atom (aka component), and can be combined with others to create the next level etc.
* Business logic should not be handled in atoms or molecules, only organisms and above.

<br>

## API Design
Brief overview of research. 

* Naming of routes should use nouns and not verbs, since the HTTP methods are verbs that let us know what is going on.
* Make use of query parameters to specify results.
* Use proper error codes and descriptive error messages to let developers know what is being done correctly or not.

## Documentation Driven Development
Brief overview of research. 

* Documentation produces consistency in the development of an application because much of the internal logic is mapped out in advance.
* Treat documentation as the first tier of bug reports and feature requests.
* Through writing the documentation, you start to see the different use cases that might need to be added.
