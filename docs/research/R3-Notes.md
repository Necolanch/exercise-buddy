## Topic

This document contains general notes related to Style & Brand

<br>

## Style Tiles
Brief overview of research. 

* Style tiles are great to establish some sort of visual language between stakeholders/clients and designers, without the full effort of creating three mockups to present.
* They do not imply specific dimensions or devices, only the fact it will be digital in some form.
* This process also allows all parties to explore potentially unfamiliar territory.

## Color Scheme
Brief overview of research. 

* Before choosing a color scheme, make sure to understand if you are working with an already established brand or not. You may need to choose some secondary colors to accent on the website.
* When choosing a web design color scheme, you may need to utilize color theory in making your selection.
* Keep in mind color psychology, the perception of colors, of other cultures that may come in contact with your website to make sure no offense is passed.

## Brand Personality
Brief overview of research. 

* Brand personality is how you would describe a brand if it were a person. This is done through images, advertisements, and the products the brand creates.
* Brands create their personality by determining their values, desired audience personality, and ask questions about your brand as if it were a human.
* The 5 pillars of brand personality are sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness, with related traits that fall into each pillar.
