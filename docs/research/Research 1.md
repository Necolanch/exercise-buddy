This document contains general notes related to Project Initiation

## Project Proposals
The three common elements of a formal project proposal.

* Project managers and/or stakeholders will want to know what problem does the project solve or what process does it affect.
* Give a clear explanation of the business value the project will deliver. Let them know the importance of the project to the organization.
* State the needs of budget, personnel, and time that it will take to complete the project. It is best to get these logistics settled up-front.

## Discovery
Brief overview of research. 

* Researching the history of an application idea is important. You want yours to stand out, but so did others with the same or similar idea. Trying to find out what made other ideas successful or fail can help when deciding on features of your application.
* Lay out desired objectives and necessary procedures for the application. Use project proposals to determine the importance of them.
* Wireframe early and decide the elements of the interface that are desired or frowned upon. Make sure to stick to any predetermined design guidelines.
