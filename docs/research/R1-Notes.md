## A day in the life of a Web Developer
Brief overview of research. 

* 50% of time is spent on projects, 25% in meetings, and 25% working on immediate bugs/emergencies 
* Version control systems are vital tools because some companies operate that all code must be reviewed by a peer.
* Project management tools that have time tracking enabled when somebody begins a task can help provide more accurate time estimates it takes to complete related tasks.

## Feature Branch Workflow
Brief overview of research. 

* Feature branches are created from the master/main branch
* Feature branches should have descriptive names
* Push commits to this branch and compare the feature branch to the master/main in a pull request for review from a more experienced peer

<br>

## Git Workflow
Brief overview of research. 

* Developers makes branches from the dev/develop branch instead of the main/master.
* The rest of the feature branch workflow rules apply to this
* This further eliminates buggy code from entering the main/master branch

The resource about a day in the life of a web developer gave me more of an expectation of what it would be like working as an entry level web developer.
