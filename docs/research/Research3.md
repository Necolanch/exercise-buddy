## SWOT Analysis
Brief overview of research. 

* The four points of SWOT are Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

## Security Risks

* Through 2021, Broken Access Control was the top risk and had more occurrences than any other kind.
* Injection sits in the third position in terms of highest risk and cross-site scripting is part of this category.

## Code Scanning
Brief overview of research. 

* The experience around fixing static analysis, vulnerabilities, and alerts.
