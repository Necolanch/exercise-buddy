## Topic

This document contains general notes related to Quality Code

<br>

## Clean Code
Brief overview of research. 

* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) improves maintainability, even if it increases code size. It can go too far though, so know when to say "It's okay to repeat this here".
* Clean code self-comments and there is no need to state the obvious, especially if naming conventions are properly done.
* Use small functions. Ensure they only do one job very well.

<br>

## Pareto Principle
Brief overview of research. 

* Roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.
* Completing 20% of daily tasks will result in 80% of the impact you create for the day. Identify the ones that will have the most impact for your team.
* Find the right balance of doing tasks you perceive as most important vs least. Make sure things do not get lost.

<br>

## Writing good README
Brief overview of research. 

* Always include titles, aim of the project, list of technologies, and how to launch the project.
* Pictures or illustrations can be helpful when somebody is giving a small glance at it.
* List features or functionalities that are a little more interesting or complex.
