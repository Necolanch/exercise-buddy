## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week I set up my repo for my project and researched/proposed an idea for my final project.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I ran into problems of finding acceptable APIs for the several project ideas I had but finally found one by researching and thinking through project ideas and if it would
align with my desired tech stack.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I got more of an expectation of what it would be like to work as an entry level web developer. I also got a little more of an understanding of Associations in Sequelize for working with SQL databases.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next I plan to start thinking through the design and how I will get the API data I am using to show on the frontend and store in the database the selections from the user.
