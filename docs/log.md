## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview - This week I set up my repo for my project and researched/proposed an idea for my final project.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I ran into problems of finding acceptable APIs for the several project ideas I had but finally found one by researching and thinking through project ideas and if it would
align with my desired tech stack.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I got more of an expectation of what it would be like to work as an entry level web developer. I also got a little more of an understanding of Associations in Sequelize for working with SQL databases.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next I plan to start thinking through the design and how I will get the API data I am using to show on the frontend and store in the database the selections from the user.

### Week 2

⚙️ Overview - This week I created my wireframe and style tile for my propose project. I also researched and learned more about why wireframes help and the importance of style tiles.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I ran into problems of getting my link to my wireframe in Penpot to be accessible so from now on I will only use Figma.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I created a low fidelity wireframe. I started figuring out how my data will be structured in the database.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next I plan to start making my prototype and making a more flushed out plan to tackle issues in development.

### Week 3

⚙️ Overview - This week I created my prototype and planned elements of my project.
<br>
🌵 Challenges - I ran into problems of keeping my protype exact to my wireframe. There are a few changes but they are for better user experience.
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I created a mostly fluid click-through prototype of my application.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - Next I plan to start thinking through the logic that is needed to achieve the core features and use cases.

### Week 4
