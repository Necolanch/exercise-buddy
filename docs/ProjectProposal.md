# [Exercise Buddy]

## Application Definition Statement

*A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*
I aim to build an application that allows people to construct their weekly workouts by creating a workout plan for a 7 day week. With the option of selecting days for rest and saving
favorite exercises for ease of access, users will be able to have a plan for their exercises rather than guessing what they are going to do that day.

## Target Market

*Using research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Are there any secondary markets have many but not all overlapping defining characteristics that should be identified and design considerations be accommodated?*
The target market would be people who are looking to get in shape and need a tool to make it seem like less work. People who need a new routine. People who travel often and need something
to help plan around their schedule. Younger ages of late 40s and below and high school education level would use this the most.

## User Profile

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*
Female, late 20s, finishing college, interested in toning muscles or losing weight

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

*Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early.*
User login to their account
User looks at their current weekly plan on the dashboard and can see the muscle groups the current plan is targeting
User searches exercises using filters such as names, muscle groups, and difficulty of exercise
User saves favorite exercises to account
User creates new weekly plan and adds exercises for each day with amount of sets and repitions per set for each exercises

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*
There are all sorts of fitness apps out there but the most popular seem to be the ones that track stats rather than helping you to plan a workout. "The researchers concluded that on any given day, exercise app users are more likely to exercise during their leisure time, as compared to those who don’t use any apps. Their research also found that these apps made it easier for users to overcome “barriers to exercise” (procrastination, lack of motivation, etc.), which is kind of the whole point of fitness apps to begin with" (Barna, 2018). This application will help by targeting those barriers.

## Pain Points

*Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*
User personalization within these apps is what makes them especially effective. "For the study, Mary Jung, ... teamed up with an unnamed fitness app company to implement a couple features like goal setting, personalized feedback and other key elements of health behavior change to their app’s users, and then monitored exercise levels in app users and non-app users. Lo and behold, the study showed that the group who did not use the improved version of the app experienced no changes in their daily routine, while the test subjects who did, exercised more." (Barna, 2018).

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*
My project is going to solve the problem by allowing users to create the workouts they want to do and think they can do. They can read descriptions of how the exercise is performed and filter searches of exercises by difficult if they are just starting out. Exercise Buddy will be different by focusing on one week exercise plans to accomodate to exercise experience of all levels. I do not think I can better solve the problem because I am lacking some media to add to the UI/UX.

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*
Gym Workout Planner & Tracker is a competing application. Their UI has videos with demonstrations of the various exercises. They also have suggestive weights for different exercises the user has done. This has more personalization than I may be to add on my own although there are some ideas I can try out to do something similar. Their workout plans that users have can go as far out to 6 weeks.

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

The key feature will be that a user can create a one week exercise plan. This is the main feature I aim to use to solve user personalization in my application. Also that users can see what muscle groups they are targeting in their current plan via a chart on the dashboard.

## Integrations

*Use of an API is expected. This can be 3rd party APIs, your own API, or a combination of data sets. Identify which integrations are planned for and outline how you will use them transformatively. For 3rd party APIs provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

I will use the following Exercises API to obtain the exercises for users to choose from: https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises
